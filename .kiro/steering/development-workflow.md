# Development Workflow Guidelines

## Code Development Process

### Before Writing Code
1. **Understand Requirements**: Clarify the task and expected outcomes
2. **Plan Approach**: Consider architecture and implementation strategy
3. **Check Dependencies**: Verify required tools and libraries are available
4. **Review Existing Code**: Understand current patterns and conventions

### During Implementation
1. **Write Clean Code**: Use clear variable names and proper structure
2. **Add Comments**: Document complex logic and design decisions
3. **Handle Errors**: Implement proper error handling and validation
4. **Test Early**: Write and run tests during development

### After Implementation
1. **Code Review**: Check for security issues and best practices
2. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
3. **Testing**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage
4. **Performance**: Consider optimization opportunities

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality
- Follow consistent formatting and style
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions and classes focused and small
- Minimize code duplication
- Implement proper error handling

### Security Considerations
- Validate all user inputs
- Use secure coding practices
- Avoid hardcoded credentials or secrets
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Keep dependencies updated

### Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests for core functionality
- Include integration tests for workflows
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Use mocking for external dependencies

## Collaboration Guidelines

### Communication
- Provide clear commit messages
- Document decisions in pull requests
- Respond promptly to review feedback
- Ask questions when uncertain

### Code Reviews
- Focus on functionality, security, and maintainability
- Provide constructive feedback
- Suggest improvements with examples
- Verify tests are adequate and passing
